# About this Repo

This is a recording of past coding challenges I've completed in [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/cglitcher/) and [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/cglitcher).

Files should typically follow the format:

    # Charlie Miller
    # [Origin Website] - [Challenge Name]
    # [Challenge Hyperlink]
    # [Date Written]
     
    [My Solution]


## Caveats

 - Not all dates have been recorded (currently being fixed)
 - Files were written within the provided editor/environment
		 - these environments automatically imported several libraries
		 - They also provided pre-defined data structures and inputs
		 - to run successfully, run it in the challenge page (follow hyperlink)
